                <textarea class="form-control custom-textarea">We have all heard many tales, telling the importance of patience but, why is it so important? And, why still many of us fail to successfully accomplish the patient state of mind. Let's discuss in detail....
                Everyone knows how important being patient is to eventually grow a success tree out of the hard-work seed that was sown years ago. Be it a startup or an investment one needs to be patient and wait for the magic of compounding. Yet, due to one or the other reasons we end up taking wrong decisions by ending our patient journey on the mid-way to glory.
                The reason for it is simply that we the humans have forgot about the sense of enough, either it is working all day for our respective jobs or earning money, irrespective of the outcome we always end up chasing for the misery of more. We have come across multiple stories of how billionaires have run out of all of their money and left out with absolutely nothing, because they never knew "when to stop?". There is a massive distance between being wealthy and staying wealthy. While being wealthy asks us to take risks and convert every opportunity into a lifetime miracle on the other hand staying wealthy demands avoidance of unnecessary risk taking, keep generating an above average returns for a longer period of time and most importantly being patient.
                Compounding is a tool that needs the emotion of patience as a fuel to keep running and generating immense outcomes. As, one smack can not transform a subtle rock into a beautiful sculpture, it needs your continuous effort and perseverance to unleash a major change. Be it habit building or money making, compounding is the key that can take you way ahead of your peers even if everyday results are not the best.

                    When Mark Manson quoted "You are wrong about everything (but so am I)" in his book with this statement he gives us a glimpse of what he wants us to acknowledge about knowledge that is every human mind is different and have different capabilities with limitless strength. However, we human beings utilize it to a certain/significant measure and there always is a scope to learn more and explore the reality beyond science.

It does not matter how much time you have invested in a particular domain where you may have an edge over others and be one of the best but the ultimate truth remains the same that "Uncertainty is the only Certain" you will never ever get to know everything about everything, you can just get better and be more accurate or less wrong than what you were before and this acceptance that you are never the OG and hence will have to keep learning leads you to a peaceful state of mind and gets you rid of all sort of insecurities by dissolving down all the egoistic thoughts and bending you towards the wise path. 

I am sharing it because maybe I understood it and found an awe-inspiring meaning out of it which can help all of us get better and I know that you all know many more things better than me so feel free to share your knowledge with anyone to everyone and contribute to make this world a better place.

                    *According to the book "IKIGAAI" people in Japan often live longer and happier than compared to people all across the globe. But why is it so? What keeps them going? and keeps them away from boredom even at an age when both their body and mind are not at their personal best. Let us find that out.
*The answer to the question is that because most of them are aware and known to their "IKIGAAI" and they deliberately follow it till the very end of their lives. "IKIGAAI" is a word formed joining multiple japanese letters that together means "The Purpose of Life" which may or may not fulfill your financial needs but will motivate you to keep going in any phase of your life. Finding your "IKIGAAI" is not too hard, you just need to focus on the activities you perform daily and find a few out that you enjoy doing the most, that you are not even aware of how much time you had spent doing that and want to continue as long as possible.
*Another key reason behind living happy is the way we deal with our stress, hiding back and pretending as there is nothing stressed up in your life is just not the way because if you hide from a challenge and tell your mind that you don't have any problem the mind will automatically find one for you and then you may get worried about things that are not actually really important. Finding a purpose also forces and stress out your brain to find the answer to "how's?". How can you follow your passion when there is already so much to do? If you are doing it, How can you do it an even better way? etc. These questions give our brain a perfect exercise to keep functioning actively in any situation.
*Never underestimate the value of "VALUES", so rather being a person who always wants, be the one to provide instead, just give it and it will come back in buckets. We all humans have the capacity to do noble as well as terrible things, the equation we end up on depends on our decisions. Out of billions of creatures The Almighty have gifted us this life as humans and it is for a purpose so it's now our duty to fulfill the purpose in a way that when we go back can match our eyes with God and proudly say you gave me the opportunity and I made a whole lot of difference down there.
THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS A LIFE OF PURPOSE.

                    *Hey all, the following article will let you know the importance of developing good habits and will let you know, are you controlling your habits or are they the one who actually is in complete control.
*WHAT IS A HABIT: So, let us first discuss what habit actually is? there can be a number of different answers to this question but to be precise "habits are your repeated beingness", what you are today, what you do every day is all part of your very own habits. When you have performed a task so many times that you really do not have to think twice before doing it again, it becomes a habit. Like, turning on the lights of a dark room or flipping off the cap of your bottle to drink water, you need not to be conscious doing all this, the sub conscious part of your mind does it all by itself.
*WHY WE NEED HABITS: Whenever we see an interview or read a statement from any person who is actually successful in life, we get so surprised hearing about their lifestyle, and start wondering "How can one be so organized? or Why is it even important to be that way?" The simple answer to all this is because if you just have a goal in your life and you are ready to work harder and harder for it you will certainly achieve it one day but, as soon as you get it you will start degrading yourself and be back on track where you started moving from because "Improvements are temporary until they become a part of who you are" you need not just worry about your goal instead you must make working hard your very own identity (or habit) because it will not only enable you to reach the goal you decided but will also help you to turning into the personality that once inspired you to choose that particular goal.
*GOOD VS BAD HABITS: There is nothing like a good or a bad habit, for example eating butter every morning may be a good habit for one who is trying to bulk and add up more muscles, but it is a bad one for who is trying to lose weight, it does not matter what habit it is what matters is that who you are and how will that particular habit affect your life. We just need to be aware that if a particular habit is good for us in long term and if it is not then do change it because "if nothing changes, nothing is going to change".
*HOW TO BUILD A HABIT: Till know we understood what habit is and how it plays an important role in developing our personality, now we will find some tricks that can help us building up a strong habit: -
1- Stop making negative statements about yourself like I cannot wake up early or I cannot study for too long because as many times you say it your brain starts believing it as a fact, instead do opposite tell everybody and yourself what great thing you are going to do or what good habit you are building upon.
2- "If you offer a right award or punishment, you can force people act in a certain way" do add a reward with each of your habit like if you want to wake up early in the morning add a reward of listening music or maybe even to surf on social media for half an hour which will be more than enough to wake you up.
3- Make sure every habit you try to build gives you a sense of satisfaction or a pleasant memory because such habits will themselves tend to repeat every day and you need not to work that hard for it.
*At last, I would say as soon as we start focusing more on our current trajectories or current path than our current results, as soon as we are more worried about the system and not about just setting goals, we develop into a better version of ourselves each and every day.

                    ARE YOU AWARE?
. Hey, guys if you are someone who is not able to give up on his/her addiction to   social media, or you spend all your day playing online games or you always tend to delay your work and opt. for relaxation. My simple question to you is ARE YOU AWARE? and you and I both know that you are certainly not.
. Let me be very clear for you, if you are seeking for a motivational video or speech to get your work done, then you are not on the right path pal. Because Motivation is all about giving you a spark, but it is not a habit that will help you do your everyday jobs. If you really want to achieve big, if you want to be at the top, if you dream to be in the 1% of whatever field you perform, then start making hard work your very own habit, just push yourselves every single day and perform till your peak.
. The reason many of us are not able to give up on their addiction to the social media or online games is because as soon as we scroll and watch the feed it gives us an instant but temporary pleasure called 'dopamine' and soon as the video gets over it suddenly vanishes but as our mind has already got addicted and was not satisfied with the short term pleasure it asks us for more, and this is where many gets trapped and they continue scrolling without being AWARE of what opportunities they are losing, or of what moments they are missing. Let us take an example of a person who loves going to gym or loves to play a sport like football or cricket and he has performed all day long on the field and was good enough there, on the other hand we have a person who was surfing on social media and his parents snatched his phone from him, they have stopped what they were doing earlier but now who do you think must be more satisfied and happy? Obviously the first one but why is it so? Because as soon as he performed on field and won his battle, he got a sense of long-term pleasure and now both of his mind and body needs to relax. This is exactly what you all can train your brains to function like, I am not asking all of you to go to the gym or start playing football, but what you can do is start exploring yourself and your passion and do that amount of hard work on it every day that you do not even have time to waste.
. Every human needs appreciation in life that is why we mostly share our images on social media, right? So why to limit ourselves in a way that appreciation comes from only a few of our followers. Instead of it what we should do is to be so punctual, so disciplined that we achieve the greatest heights in our lives and conquer our biggest fears and then the whole world will be happily forced to appreciate us. The person who doesn't knew you yesterday starts appreciating you today that is called success and that is the Motivation you need to look for. At the end I would just like to say that always be honest to yourself and whenever you feel that you are wasting your time ask yourselves "ARE YOU AWARE?"
Thank You
